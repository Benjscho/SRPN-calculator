# SRPN reconstruction

This project was to recreate a saturated reverse polish notation calculator
provided as a *black box* binary, this can be found in bin. The goal was to
recreate the functionality of the binary provided as accurately as possible
by interacting with the program and discovering its functionality.

## Instructions on use

To use or run the SRPN, run:
```bash
python srpn.py
```
from the root folder. You can then interact with the program.

To run automated tests stored in `test_srpn.py` you can run `pytest` from the terminal too.
